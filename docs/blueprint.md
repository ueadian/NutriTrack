## Original User Request:
Create me an app that allows me to track my nutritional goals. It should allow me to enter in my Calories target as well as my Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates and Sugar goals for the day. I should be able to take a picture of a label on a food item and you should use some sort of OCR or AI model to read the label and extract relevant data about the food. I'd like the app to store the data of the foods I scan in by letting me give them a name. When I want to use the item I should be able to specify a serving size, say .5 or 1.5 of a serving of that food. Please ask any clarifying questions you need to accomplish this.
